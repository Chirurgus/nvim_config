# (N)Vim configuration

This repository contains my configuration for vim. I found that I don't
really need any NeoVim specific features so I primarily focus on VIM.

To install copy the contents `vimfiles` to `~/vimfiles` (or `~/.vim` on Linux).
To make NeoVim use the same configuration copy `init.vim` to $MYVIMRC.
Then install plugins using `:PlugInstall`.
